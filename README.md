# Sleep-Health
An analysis of how lifestyle habits and health factors influence sleep quality and overall well-being. Using a dataset of 374 individuals and 13 key variables—including demographic details, BMI category, stress level, physical activity, and sleep metrics—the study examines patterns that contribute to sleep disorders and poor sleep hygiene.


This project presents a comprehensive analysis of how lifestyle habits and health factors influence sleep quality and overall well-being. Using a dataset of 374 individuals and 13 key variables—including demographic details, BMI category, stress level, physical activity, and sleep metrics—the study examines patterns that contribute to sleep disorders and poor sleep hygiene.

Through statistical analysis and visualization, the project explores the relationship between physical activity and sleep quality, the impact of stress on sleep duration, and how occupation and BMI contribute to sleep-related problems. The findings highlight that high stress, low activity, and unhealthy BMI levels are strongly linked to lower sleep quality.

In addition to uncovering patterns, the project demonstrates the potential to predict sleep disorder risk using machine learning models such as logistic regression or classification algorithms. By identifying key risk factors, the study provides practical recommendations for improving sleep through exercise, stress management, and healthier lifestyle choices.
